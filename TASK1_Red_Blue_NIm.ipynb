    "# Red-Blue Nim \n",
    " The game is a two-player turn-based game where players take turns removing marbles from two piles. The game can be played in two versions: Standard and Mis√®re, with different winning and losing conditions. The script allows either a human or a computer to play, with the computer's moves determined by a placeholder decision-making function."

    "Initialization\n",
    "__init__(self, num_red, num_blue, version='standard', first_player='computer', depth=None): The constructor initializes the game with the given number of red and blue marbles, the game version, the first player, and an optional search depth for the computer's decision-making.\n",
    "Game Over Check\n",
    "is_game_over(self): This method checks if the game is over by determining if either pile of marbles is empty.\n",

    "-Making a Move\n",
    "\n",
    "make_move(self, player, red, blue): This method updates the game state by removing the specified number of red and blue marbles for the given player.\n",
    "Human Player Move\n",

    "-Computer Player Move\n",
    "\n",
    "computer_move(self): This method handles the computer player's move. It uses the minmax_decision method to determine the move (currently a placeholder that always returns 1 red and 1 blue marble) and updates the game state.\n",

    "-Decision-Making Placeholder\n",
    "\n",
    "minmax_decision(self): This method is a placeholder for the MinMax decision-making algorithm. It currently returns a move of removing 1 red and 1 blue marble.\n",
    "\n",
    "-Main Game Loop\n",
    "\n",
    "play(self): This method contains the main game loop. It alternates turns between the human and computer players until the game is over. It then prints the result based on the game version and the last player to move.\n",
